<p>
The <b>VAquaClient</b> package provides an API for applications that use the
<a href="https://violetlib.org/vaqua/overview.html"><b>VAqua</b></a>
look and feel.
This library uses <b>VAqua</b>, but does not require it, so it can be used by applications
that optionally use <b>VAqua</b>.

<p>
The services provided include:
<ul>

<li>
Obtaining information about the current appearance and associated system colors on
macOS. This information can be used to create UIs that work effectively using both the
light and dark appearances.
</li>

<li>
Displaying windows as macOS sheets.
</li>

<li>
Constructing rows of buttons that can be displayed as a segmented control using <b>VAqua</b>.
